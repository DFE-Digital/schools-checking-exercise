          Some schools will have a lot of pupils, this gives them a way to find
          pupils through their name or UPN while still maintaining
          accessibility.

          On the evidence page the text area is mandatory and asks for an
          explanation why the merge needs to happen. This has been implemented
          as it's own question in the journey.

          This text area is not relevant to evidence being uploaded, especially
          since evidence is optional and this is mandatory. This makes it more
          straightforward for the user to understand what is needed from them.
