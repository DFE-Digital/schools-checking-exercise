          Change the flow so the user can answer the minimum amount of questions
          to get to their summary and evidence page.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          This means that when the user answers Yes to questions that fulfil a
          removal criteria they skip the remaining questions. For example,
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>'Have they been diagnosed with a terminal illness? Yes or No'</li>
          <li>Yes - 'Have they sat any year 11 exams? Yes or No'</li>
          <li>Journey goes to Summary, then Evidence.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold"
            >Reason to change:</span
          >
          The user has to answer every question in the flow even if they fulfil
          the first case of the pupil being diagnosed with a terminal illness.
          This could cause stress and worry that the pupil does not fulfil the
          right criteria.
