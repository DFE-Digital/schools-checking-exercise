          On the evidence page the text area is mandatory and asks for an
          explanation why the pupil was still on roll in January 2024's census
          day. This has been implemented as it's own question in the journey.

          This text area is not relevant to evidence being uploaded. This makes
          it more straightforward for the user to understand what is needed from
          them.

          If the user does not know the URN of the school or college they have
          to leave the service to find it. There doesn't seem to be an option to
          enter the school or college name either, assuming that this would be
          more memorable for the user. This breaks up their journey and makes it
          inefficient and more effort for them.
