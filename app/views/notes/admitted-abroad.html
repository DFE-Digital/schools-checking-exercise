          Selects have accessibility issues, this allows the user to type the

        <p class="govuk-body">
          <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Reason:</span>
          If we don't need to collect information, we shouldn't. It seems
          mandatory on the form, so including it made sense.

          If these dates are different, this will mean they are entered in
          chronological order. This is more straightforward for the user and
          means they won't have to jump around in the timeline.

          Provide a clearer list of more descriptive options and include how

          This could even be restructured to more straightforward questions
          depending on what is needed from this question. For example,
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>'Do you know their first language? Yes or No'</li>
          <li>Yes - 'What is their first language? Accessible autocomplete'</li>
          <li>
            No - 'Is this believed to be English, or have they refused to
            disclose this? Yes or No'
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          This will not cover all scenarios as it's not clear how these answers
          impact the user and the outcome.
        </p>

          >
          The options are not fully clear. 'Not known but believed English' and
          'Not known but believed other than English' seem to put the
          responsibility on the user, with no knowledge about how this impacts
          the outcome.

          Change the structure of these questions, for example
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>
            'When did they enrol at a school or college in England?', then
          </li>
          <li>
            'Is this the same date that they enrolled at your school or college?
            Yes or No'
          </li>
          <li>Yes - 'When did they enrol at your school or college?'</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          This helps break the question style up, helping the user understand
          the differences in questions.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold"
            >Reason to change:</span
          >
          'When did they enrol at a school or college in England?' and 'When did
          they enrol at your school or college?' are extremely similar questions
          that could cause confusion among users.
