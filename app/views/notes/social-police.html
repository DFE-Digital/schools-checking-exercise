          The current questions are wordy and difficult to understand, splitting
          them gives the user more time to understand what is being asked of
          them. This also aligns with what is asked in the guidance.

          According to the guidance and current questions these are the only
          times we need to know if the pupil has been impacted in a severe way.
          This change means we can ask the users only relevant questions and not
          increase their cognitive load unnecessarily.

          Change the flow so the user can answer the minimum amount of questions
          to get to their summary and evidence page.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          This means that when the user answers Yes to questions that fulfil a
          removal criteria they skip the remaining questions. For example,
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>
            'Have they recently been involved with social services? Yes or No'
          </li>
          <li>
            Yes - 'Has this had a severe and profound effect on their ability to
            access education and sit exams? Yes or No''
          </li>
          <li>Yes - 'Have they sat any year 11 exams? Yes or No'</li>
          <li>Journey goes to Summary, then Evidence.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          <span class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold"
            >Reason to change:</span
          >
          The user has to answer every question in the flow even if they fulfil
          the first case of the pupil being involved with the police and this
          having a severe and profound impact on them. This could cause stress
          and worry that the pupil does not fulfil the right criteria.
